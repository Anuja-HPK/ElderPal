  <li>Leverages cloud storage solutions for easy access and management of health reports by authorized users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Machine Learning Techniques and Algorithms 🧠🔍</h2>
<p>ElderCareConnect employs various machine learning techniques and algorithms to provide an intuitive and responsive user experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Speech Emotion Recognition:</strong> Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze vocal patterns and infer emotional states from the elder's speech.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset Information 📊</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>To power the speech emotion recognition feature within ElderPal, we leverage a comprehensive dataset designed to capture a wide range of human emotions through speech. This dataset plays a critical role in training our machine learning models, ensuring accurate and nuanced emotion detection.</p>

<h3>Composition</h3>
<p>The dataset consists of recordings from two female actors, aged 26 and 64 years, who spoke a set of 200 target words in the carrier phrase "Say the word _." Each actor portrayed seven different emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral. In total, the dataset comprises 2800 audio files, offering a robust foundation for analyzing and understanding emotional speech.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Actors: Two female actors.</li>
  <li>Emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Pleasant Surprise, Sadness, Neutral.</li>
  <li>Data Points: 2800 audio files.</li>
  <li>Format: WAV format for high-quality audio analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset is meticulously organized to facilitate ease of access and processing. Each actor's recordings are stored in dedicated folders, categorized by emotion. Within these emotion-specific folders, you can find the 200 target words audio files for each emotion portrayed.</p>

<h2>Neural Network Architecture</h2>
<p>Our speech emotion recognition system is built on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. The LSTM architecture is chosen for its proficiency in handling sequential data and its ability to remember information for long periods, making it ideal for speech analysis.</p>
